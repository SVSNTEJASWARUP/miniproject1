The Student Grade Checker is a user-friendly software solution designed to manage, calculate,
and store academic records of students. The system allows for the input and calculation of
important academic metrics such as SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average) and CGPA
(Cumulative Grade Point Average) based on marks obtained in various subjects across multiple
semesters. Additionally, the application supports the storage and retrieval of student data in a
text file for future reference. An admin interface allows authorized users to view and delete
records, ensuring smooth and efficient management of student information. The system uses a
graphical user interface (GUI) developed with Tkinter, providing an intuitive and interactive
experience for both students and administrators. The solution aims to streamline the process of
managing student academic data while ensuring the accuracy and security of records.
The system also includes features such as automatic grade calculation based on predefined
thresholds for marks, making it easier for students and administrators to track academic
performance without manual intervention. It supports flexible handling of data across multiple
semesters, allowing students to update their records as they progress through their academic
journey. The integration of file management ensures that all student data is persistently stored,
easily retrievable, and secure, while also allowing for quick data updates by administrators. By
providing a simple yet powerful tool for managing academic records, the system contributes to
reducing administrative workload and enhances the overall efficiency of academic data
handling in educational institutions.
